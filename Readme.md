# Chikara

Chikara is a program for allowing players with motor-functioning
difficulty to play a certain card game. This card game features many
tasks which would require many fine hand movements, including moving
and counting many small tokens and the rotation of a dial consisting
of two pieces of cardboard joined by a plastic pin through their
centers.

Chikara allows players to keep track of their small tokens as numerical,
in-program values, and facilitates the manipulation of the dial
according to the needs of the game.

## Do I need Chikara?

Probably not. If you don't have difficulties with motor function, and
you have no idea what game it's for, then you likely don't need it.
